# hangman
A javascript based project where if we type the correct letter it display the letter otherwise the figure is displayed and we lose the game. We need to store the word in our js file and display "" if we haven't typed that word otherwise we can display that particular letter. 
wordEl.innerText.replace(/\n/g, '') is use to compare it with actual word. innerText doesn't show us hidden element.
